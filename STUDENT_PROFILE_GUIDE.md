## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Profile Page Not Loading?
1. Check if you're logged in as **Student** role
2. Verify the URL contains the student profile route
3. Check browser console for errors

### Navigation Not Working?
1. Verify you're logged in (not on home page)
2. Check that user dropdown opens
3. Look for "My Profile" menu item

### Data Not Saving?
- This is **expected** - backend not yet connected
- Check console (F12) to see data is being logged
- Future: Will be connected to API endpoint

## 💡 Tips for Development

### Modifying the Form
- **Add new field**: Copy existing field structure in `StudentProfile.tsx`
- **Change styling**: Update Tailwind classes
- **Add validation**: Use React Hook Form (to be implemented)

### Connecting to Backend
```typescript
// Example future implementation
const handleSave = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/student/profile', {
      method: 'PUT',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(formData)
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    toast.success('Profile updated successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error('Failed to update profile');
  }
};
```
