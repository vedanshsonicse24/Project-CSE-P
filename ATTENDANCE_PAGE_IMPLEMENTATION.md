## 📊 Component Structure

### **AttendancePageNew Props:**
```typescript
interface AttendancePageNewProps {
  userRole?: "student" | "faculty";  // Determines which view to show
  onBack?: () => void;               // Called when back button is clicked
}
```

### **Data Interfaces:**
```typescript
interface ClassAttendance {
  classCode: string;
  className: string;
  totalClasses: number;
  attendedClasses: number;
  percentage: number;
  lastMarked: string;
}

interface AttendanceRecord {
  date: string;
  status: "present" | "absent" | "leave";
  time?: string;
  subject?: string;
}
```

## 🎯 Integration Points

### **Student Dashboard:**
- Attendance card → Triggers `setActiveSection('attendance')`
- Switch case handles rendering `<AttendancePageNew userRole="student" />`
- Back button calls `setActiveSection('dashboard')`

### **Faculty Dashboard:**
- Attendance card → Triggers `setActiveSection('attendance')`
- Switch case handles rendering `<AttendancePageNew userRole="faculty" />`
- Back button calls `setActiveSection('dashboard')`

---

## 🎨 Visual Design

### **Color Scheme:**
- **Green**: Good attendance (≥85%)
- **Yellow**: Average attendance (75-84%)
- **Red**: Low attendance (<75%)
- **Blue**: Primary actions and backgrounds
- **Gradient**: Background with blue and gray tones

### **Responsive Design:**
- **Desktop**: Full table layout with multiple columns
- **Tablet**: Adjusted grid columns and spacing
- **Mobile**: Single column layout with scrollable tables
