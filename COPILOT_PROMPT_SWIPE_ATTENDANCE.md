## Main Prompt for Copilot

```
I need to implement a mobile-optimized swipe-based attendance marking system for Faculty and Super Admin dashboards. This should work exactly like Outlook/Mailbox swipe gestures.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. CREATE COMPONENT: SwipeableAttendanceRow.tsx
   Location: src/components/faculty/SwipeableAttendanceRow.tsx
   
   Features Required:
   - Touch event handlers (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
   - Swipe LEFT (‚Üê) to mark student PRESENT (‚úîÔ∏è) with GREEN visual feedback
   - Swipe RIGHT (‚Üí) to mark student ABSENT (‚ùå) with RED visual feedback
   - Minimum swipe threshold: 80px before action triggers
   - Maximum visual swipe distance: 150px
   - Prevent vertical scroll during horizontal swipe (touchAction: 'pan-y')
   - Show background indicator icons (Check/X) that fade in during swipe
   - Center icon appears when threshold is crossed
   - Haptic feedback (vibration) on mobile when action completes
   - Loading state with spinner during API call
   - Visual feedback: row flashes green (present) or red (absent) for 600ms
   - Desktop fallback: clickable ‚úîÔ∏è and ‚ùå buttons
   - Dark mode support throughout
   - Accessibility: focus states, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
   - Props: studentId, studentName, rollNumber, initialStatus, onStatusChange, disabled
   - Use lucide-react icons: Check, X
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling with cn() utility function
   - Component should be memoized for performance

2. CREATE DEMO PAGE: AttendanceScheduleDemo.tsx
   Location: src/components/faculty/AttendanceScheduleDemo.tsx
   
   Features Required:
   - Complete attendance interface with class info header
   - Display: Subject name, Section, Date, Time
   - Statistics dashboard with 4 cards: Total, Present, Absent, Attendance %
   - List of students (sample data: 8 students with names, roll numbers)
   - Each student uses SwipeableAttendanceRow component
   - Quick action buttons: "Mark All Present", "Mark All Absent"
   - Submit attendance button (disabled until all marked)
   - Mobile tip card explaining swipe gestures
   - Export button for attendance data
   - Real-time statistics update as attendance is marked
   - Toast notifications using sonner
   - API integration ready with async handleAttendanceChange function
   - Responsive design: mobile, tablet, desktop layouts
   - Use shadcn/ui components: Card, Button, Input

3. CREATE CSS FILE: swipe-attendance-animations.css
   Location: src/styles/swipe-attendance-animations.css
   
   Required Animations:
   - swipe-feedback-present: background color animation (green flash 600ms)
   - swipe-feedback-absent: background color animation (red flash 600ms)
   - haptic-pulse: scale animation for tactile feedback (100ms)
   - swipe-icon-appear: icon fade and scale in (150ms)
   - attendance-spinner: loading rotation animation (600ms infinite)
   - checkmark-pop: success checkmark scale animation (300ms)
   - error-shake: error shake effect (400ms)
   - swipe-hint: tutorial hint animation (1.5s infinite)
   - stat-animation: statistics counter animation (400ms)
   
   Required Styles:
   - .swipeable-row: disable text selection, remove tap highlights
   - .attendance-button: minimum 44x44px touch targets for mobile
   - .attendance-button:active: scale down effect (0.95)
   - Status badges: present (green gradient), absent (red gradient), unmarked (gray)
   - Focus states for accessibility (2px blue outline)
   - Dark mode variants for all animations
   - Responsive adjustments for mobile (<640px)
   - Support for prefers-reduced-motion
   - Support for prefers-contrast (high contrast borders)

4. INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Add CSS import to src/main.tsx: import './styles/swipe-attendance-animations.css';
   - Add Toaster component from sonner to App.tsx: <Toaster position="top-right" richColors />
   - Create route for demo: /attendance-demo ‚Üí AttendanceScheduleDemo component
   - Ensure lucide-react is installed: npm install lucide-react
   - Ensure sonner is installed: npm install sonner

5. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
   
   Touch Gesture Logic:
   ```typescript
   - Track touchStart X/Y coordinates
   - Calculate deltaX on touchMove
   - Ignore if abs(deltaY) > abs(deltaX) (vertical scroll)
   - Call preventDefault() on horizontal swipe
   - Limit swipe offset between -150px and +150px
   - Trigger action if offset > 80px (right) or < -80px (left)
   - Animate row transform: translateX(offset)
   - Show background color: rgba with opacity based on offset/threshold
   ```
   
   API Integration Pattern:
   ```typescript
   const handleAttendanceChange = async (studentId: string, status: 'present' | 'absent') => {
     try {
       await fetch('/api/attendance/mark', {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
         body: JSON.stringify({ studentId, status, date: new Date().toISOString() })
       });
       toast.success(`Marked as ${status === 'present' ? 'Present ‚úì' : 'Absent ‚úó'}`);
     } catch (error) {
       toast.error('Failed to update attendance');
       throw error;
     }
   };
   ```
   
   State Management:
   ```typescript
   - status: 'present' | 'absent' | 'unmarked'
   - swipeOffset: number (current swipe distance)
   - isSwiping: boolean
   - showFeedback: boolean (for flash animation)
   - feedbackType: 'present' | 'absent' | null
   - isUpdating: boolean (API call in progress)
   ```

6. COLOR SCHEME:
   - Present: Green (#10b981, #059669) with opacity variants
   - Absent: Red (#ef4444, #dc2626) with opacity variants
   - Unmarked: Gray (#6b7280, #4b5563)
   - Backgrounds: White/Gray-50 (light), Gray-800 (dark)
   - Borders: Gray-200 (light), Gray-700 (dark)
   - Text: Gray-900 (light), White (dark)

7. RESPONSIVE BREAKPOINTS:
   - Mobile: < 640px (compact layout, full swipe functionality)
   - Tablet: 640px - 1024px (standard layout)
   - Desktop: > 1024px (spacious layout, buttons more prominent)

8. ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:
   - All buttons have aria-label
   - Focus ring on keyboard navigation (2px solid, 2px offset)
   - Color contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1
   - Touch targets minimum 44x44px
   - Screen reader announcements for status changes
   - Keyboard shortcuts: Tab to navigate, Enter to toggle

9. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Use React.memo for SwipeableAttendanceRow
   - Debounce rapid swipes
   - Prevent double-submit with isUpdating flag
   - Cleanup timeouts on unmount
   - Limit re-renders with proper dependency arrays

10. VISUAL FEEDBACK TIMELINE:
    ```
    0ms: Touch start
    100-300ms: Swipe in progress, show indicators
    300ms: Touch end, threshold crossed
    350ms: Trigger haptic (50ms vibration)
    400ms: API call starts, show spinner
    500-900ms: API response
    900ms: Flash color background
    1000ms: Show toast notification
    1500ms: Fade to neutral, animation complete
    ```

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Ensure all TypeScript types are properly defined
- Handle all error cases gracefully
- Test on both mobile and desktop
- Support both light and dark modes
- Make it production-ready with proper error handling
- Follow React best practices (hooks, memoization)
- Use Tailwind CSS classes, no inline styles except transform/backgroundColor during swipe
- Component should be reusable and configurable
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

SAMPLE DATA for Demo:
```typescript
const sampleStudents = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Aarav Kumar', rollNumber: 'CSE2023001', attendanceStatus: 'unmarked' },
  { id: '2', name: 'Priya Sharma', rollNumber: 'CSE2023002', attendanceStatus: 'unmarked' },
  { id: '3', name: 'Rohan Patel', rollNumber: 'CSE2023003', attendanceStatus: 'unmarked' },
  { id: '4', name: 'Ananya Singh', rollNumber: 'CSE2023004', attendanceStatus: 'unmarked' },
  { id: '5', name: 'Arjun Reddy', rollNumber: 'CSE2023005', attendanceStatus: 'unmarked' },
  { id: '6', name: 'Sneha Gupta', rollNumber: 'CSE2023006', attendanceStatus: 'unmarked' },
  { id: '7', name: 'Vikram Joshi', rollNumber: 'CSE2023007', attendanceStatus: 'unmarked' },
  { id: '8', name: 'Ishita Verma', rollNumber: 'CSE2023008', attendanceStatus: 'unmarked' },
];
```

Please create all three files with complete, production-ready code following these exact specifications.
