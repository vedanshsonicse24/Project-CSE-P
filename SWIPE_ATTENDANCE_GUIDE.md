**Steps:**
1. Open your browser
2. Go to `http://localhost:3002`
3. Add `/attendance-demo` to the URL
4. Press Enter

### Option 2: Add to Navigation (Recommended for Faculty)

You can add a button to the Faculty Dashboard to navigate to this page:

**In FacultyDashboard.tsx, add:**
```tsx
<Button onClick={() => window.location.href = '/attendance-demo'}>
  Mark Attendance
</Button>
```

Or better yet, update `App.tsx` to accept navigation:
```tsx
// In your navigation handler
setCurrentPage("attendance-demo")
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Swipe not working
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you're in mobile device mode (DevTools)
- Try swiping with more force (>80px)
- Check console for errors

### Issue: No haptic feedback
**Solution:**
- Haptic only works on real mobile devices
- Not available in DevTools simulation
- Test on actual phone to feel vibration

### Issue: Animations not smooth
**Solution:**
- Check if "Reduce motion" is enabled in OS settings
- Disable if testing animations
- Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion

### Issue: Can't see toast notifications
**Solution:**
- Toaster already configured in App.tsx
- Check if sonner is installed: `npm list sonner`
- Look for notifications in top-right corner

### Issue: Statistics not updating
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify state is updating (React DevTools)
- Refresh page and try again

  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    studentId, 
    status, 
    date: new Date().toISOString() 
  })
});
```

**API Endpoint Expected:**

  {
    "studentId": "1",
    "status": "present",
    "date": "2025-10-30T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
  ```
- **Response:** 200 OK
